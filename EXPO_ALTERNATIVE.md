# üîÑ Alternative: Expo Development Build

If you want to try deploying without a Mac (limited functionality):

## Option: Expo Application Services (EAS)

### 1. Convert to Expo
```bash
# Install Expo CLI
npm install -g @expo/cli

# Initialize Expo in existing project
npx create-expo-app --template blank-typescript VideoStartExpo
```

### 2. Configure for Camera
```json
// app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "VideoStart",
    "slug": "videostart",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "platforms": ["ios"],
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-camera",
        {
          "cameraPermission": "VideoStart needs camera access for high-speed recording."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Cloud Build
```bash
# Build for iOS in cloud
eas build --platform ios

# Install on device via TestFlight
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations of Expo Approach:**
- **No 240fps support** - Limited to standard camera APIs
- **Reduced performance** - Cannot access native AVFoundation directly
- **Limited camera control** - No frame-by-frame processing
- **Cloud dependency** - Requires internet for builds

## üèÜ **Recommendation:**
**Use a Mac with the full React Native setup** for the complete 240fps VideoStart experience.

The Expo approach will work for basic video recording but won't achieve the high-performance requirements of your race timing application.
